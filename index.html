              A fx sound file depicting echolocation in bats. Bats use echolocation to hunt for food,
              identify their surroundings, and for social interactions. For bats, it even provides the means
              for identifying individuals (<a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000400">Yovel et al, 2009</a>).

              Bio-sonar-inspired technologies provide a window into the complex lives of mammals who depend on echolocation,
              and thereby support the argument that technological advancements provide advancements to research.

              Ornithologists studying owls have, thanks to improvements made to amplification sound equipments,
              been able studying owl species movements, strategies and behaviours by sampling sounds from them and mimicking the recordings back into their
              habitats in hope of a response. Due to their incredible hearing and range, this was previously much harder to accomplish.

              The tawny owl is an owl species commonly studied by researchers, and their call is included in this row.

              Increasingly, researchers have been phasing out night vision surveillance technologies in favor for
              thermal imaging. This is incredibly favorable for spotting hidden nocturnal animals such as bats and owls
              (see image attached, featuring an in-flight barn owl), as thermal imaging is not reliant on light to work. Thermal imaging
              equipment is expensive, and due to poorer funding, this used to be a larger barrier to entry for many researchers than it is today.
              However, it is important to note that thermal imaging it not an absolute substitute for night vision, with both having their advantages
              and drawbacks.

              Drones are more frequently being used in assessing potential ecological threats from afar, being able to both capture more footage and distance.
              Additionally, it paves the way for new scientific innovation through adopting these
              machines to a wider range of new and experimental methodologies. The-Scientist reported on such applications for drones, stating a PhD student at Macquarie University used
              drones to capture biological data pertaining to the blow from a whale's blowhole, which contains DNA, hormones, as well as bacteria.

              This clip shows a methodology for guaging optimism through
              associative learning in the wild chicken, the Red Jungle Fowl (<em>G.g. gallus</em>)(RJF).
              <br><br>
              Ethology is one of the research fields within Animal Biology that suffer from poorer funding in general,
              despite being a growing field. The methodology conveyed in the video is generally a sound way of testing
              associative and reversal learning, although it is susceptible to a wider range of human errors.
              Additionally, whether this methodology effectively encompasses optimism as an observable behaviour remains questionable,
              due to a several factors not accounted for in this expirement. Innovate technologies can improve on such
              methods by, for instance, embracing 3D printing to better design and create testing arenas featuring stables and which,
              when joint with electrical engineering and scripts, may automate and register the chicken's test times, movement patterns and more.
              This data can subsequently be ran through a local database and statistical models can be ran automatically from this data.
              Such developments would effectively eliminate a larger degree of human bias and error, as well as save the researcher
              time and money in the long-term. This, consequently, may provide room for additional research in these subjects
              research subjects (e.g., studying boldness as well as various other observable behaviours in the RJF).

              Opsin-3 is a gene protein found in human retina cells and is responsible for providing us access to a wider range
              of colors within the color spectrum.
              <br><br>
              It is believed to be evolved as a result of a mutation in a duplicate gene of opsin-2. Colorblind individuals
              lack opsin-3, or the gene itself may be knocked out (inactive) or otherwise mutated. Most mammals, including primates, are colorblind
              to varying color ranges that exist on the spectrum.
              <br><br>
              In the shown clip, AAVs (adeno-associated viruses) were genetically engineered to inject the opsin-3 gene into the retina cells
              of a squirrel-monkey (<em>Saimiri</em>)(not shown in the footage), resulting in the test subject being able to
              successfully identify and pass color tests it previously had failed due to the limited range of visual colors that was available to it.
              The video both directly and indirectly showcases the importance of technological advancements to modern research.
              <br><br>
              Currently, aav injections are considered an expiremental treatment for colorblindness in humans.

        I struggled a long time to find a passion in life, but ultimately realized that what I want to do is work in an academic setting
        where I may utilize the skills picked up during this degree with my love for animals and animal ecology. The above table serves to justify
        the career path I envision for myself. Once my undergrad studies are complete, I will work towards a postgrad degree in bioinformatics first.
        Next, I aim to complete a second MSc in evolutionary ecology to compliment my skills, ensuring that I build up relevant experience in the meantime.

        The content in the table also shows how these two fields compliment one another extremely well.
